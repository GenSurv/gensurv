NS is a member of a family of developmental disorders termed “Rasopathies”, caused mainly by gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway proteins.Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and trio-based genomic triangulation was performed on a 15-year old, female with a clinical diagnosis of NS and concomitant cardiac hypertrophy and her unaffected parents. Sequencing data was analyzed using Golden Helix VarSeq software with appropriate filters to identify rare, de novo variants or those inherited in a compound heterozygous or homozygous recessive manner. Homology-based modeling and molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) were performed for wildtype (WT) MRAS and the G23V-MRAS variant. Comparative analyses measured changes in bonding patterns, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF). A subsequent cohort analysis was performed and 110 phenotype-positive, genotype-negative NS patients were sequenced for additional NS-associated mutations in MRAS .Results: Following analysis and filtering, WES identified 176 candidate variants in 67 genes, and subsequent gene ranking identified MRAS (G23V) as the most likely novel NS-susceptibility gene. MRAS- encoded RAS-related protein 3 (MRAS) interacts directly with the MAPK pathway via SHOC2 and PP1. Molecular modeling, in silico mutagenesis, and MDS indicate that G23V-MRAS impacts effector interaction regions and the GTP binding site, supporting the notion that G23V-MRAS is an activated form of MRAS, akin to the established activating mutations at G13 in MRAS’ paralogue HRAS . Subsequent cohort analysis identified an additional rare, de novo T68I-MRAS missense mutation in a female NS patient.Conclusions: Herein, with the discovery of a two de novo variants (G23V and T68I) identified by WES or direct DNA sequencing, we have established MRAS as the newest NS-susceptibility gene. MRAS plays a crucial role in the NS-associated Ras/MAPK pathway and interacts directly with several previously identified NS-associated proteins.	Erin M.

This commentary presents an overview of what is known about the costs and cost-effectiveness of genomic sequencing. We discuss the cost of germline genomic sequencing, addressing factors that have facilitated the decrease in sequencing costs to date and anticipating the factors that will drive sequencing costs in the future. We then address the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic and pharmacogenomic applications of genomic sequencing, with an emphasis on the implications for secondary findings disclosure and the integration of genomic sequencing into general patient care. Throughout, we ground the discussion by describing efforts in the MedSeq Project, an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial, to understand the costs and cost-effectiveness of integrating whole genome sequencing into cardiology and primary care settings.

With robotics widely used in bioanalytical assays, accurate system performance is essential to ensure the quality and productivity of the robotics. In our lab, an automated calibration procedure has been developed to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the TECAN (Research Triangle Park, NC, U.S.A.) Genesis liquid handling system in a bioanalytical laboratory setting. The calibrations were performed by transferring and weighing the solvents automatically on a microbalance controlled by a Gemini program. From the data acquired, calibration reports were generated using a template. The novel aspect of this approach is the use of an on-line balance and a density meter, both of which combine to make the calibration process simple, efficient, and precise. For quantitative bioanalysis, a variety of solvents, including methanol, water, mixed solvents, and plasma, are typically used to prepare standards and unknown samples. Density information is usually unknown for the mixed solvents, and the density of plasma can vary from species to species. However, with the use of a universal density meter, the density could be obtained in seconds. The issue of solvent evaporation during the calibration process was also addressed. Calibration curves were set up for various liquid classes. Pipetting volumes ranged from 10 microL to 900 microL. Precision and accuracy results obtained from the semiannual performance evaluations showed this procedure to be reliable and user-friendly. Using the automated calibration procedure, the calibration and performance evaluation of the robotic system is considerably more efficient, and the incidence of unacceptable precision and accuracy is greatly reduced.

In experiments such as gene sequencing, protein crystallization, antibody testing, and drug screening, liquid biosamples frequently must be transferred between containers of varying sizes and/or dispensed onto substrates of varying types. The sample volumes are usually small, at the micro- or nanoliter level, and the number of transferred samples can be huge when investigating large-scope combinatorial conditions. Under these conditions, liquid handling by hand is tedious, time-consuming, and impractical. Consequently, there is a strong demand for automated liquid-handling methods such as sensor-integrated robotic systems. In this article, we survey the current state of the art in automatic liquid handling, including technologies developed by both industry and research institutions. We focus on methods for dealing with small volumes at high throughput and point out challenges for future advancements.	F.

Advances in sequencing technology, collectively referred to as next generation sequencing (NGS), mean the entire cancer genome or parts of it can now be sequenced at speed with increased depth and sensitivity. However, translation of NGS into routine cancer care has been slow. Healthcare stakeholders are unclear about the clinical utility of NGS and are concerned it could be an expensive addition to cancer diagnostics, rather than an affordable alternative to single gene testing. Methods and findings We validated a 46-gene hotspot cancer panel assay allowing multiple gene testing from small diagnostic biopsies. From 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013, solid tumour samples (including non-small-cell lung carcinoma [NSCLC], colorectal carcinoma, and melanoma) were sequenced in the context of the UK National Health Service from 351 consecutively submitted prospective cases for which treating clinicians thought the patient had potential to benefit from more extensive genetic analysis. Following histological assessment, tumour-rich regions of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections underwent macrodissection, DNA extraction, NGS, and analysis using a pipeline centred on Torrent Suite software. With a median turnaround time of seven working days, an integrated clinical report was produced indicating the variants detected, including those with potential diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic, or clinical trial entry implications. Accompanying phenotypic data were collected, and a detailed cost analysis of the panel compared with single gene testing was undertaken to assess affordability for routine patient care. Panel sequencing was successful for 97% (342/351) of tumour samples in the prospective cohort and showed 100% concordance with known mutations (detected using cobas assays). At least one mutation was identified in 87% (296/342) of tumours. A locally actionable mutation (i.e., available targeted treatment or clinical trial) was identified in 122/351 patients (35%). Forty patients received targeted treatment, in 22/40 (55%) cases solely due to use of the panel. Examination of published data on the potential efficacy of targeted therapies showed theoretically actionable mutations (i.e., mutations for which targeted treatment was potentially appropriate) in 66% (71/107) and 39% (41/105) of melanoma and NSCLC patients, respectively. At a cost of £339 (US$449) per patient, the panel was less expensive locally than performing more than two or three single gene tests. Study limitations include the use of FFPE samples, which do not always provide high-quality DNA, and the use of “real world” data: submission of cases for sequencing did not always follow clinical guidelines, meaning that when mutations were detected, patients were not always eligible for targeted treatments on clinical grounds. Conclusions This study demonstrates that more extensive tumour sequencing can identify mutations that could improve clinical decision-making in routine cancer care, potentially improving patient outcomes, at an affordable level for healthcare providers.

However, microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) present unique problems for sequencing and downstream analysis based on their unique physiology and the composition of their genomes. In this study, we compare the quality of sequence data generated using the Nextera and TruSeq isolate preparation kits for library construction prior to Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis. Our results confirm that MTB NGS data quality is highly dependent on the purity of the DNA sample submitted for sequencing and its guanine-cytosine content (or GC-content). Our data additionally demonstrate that the choice of library preparation method plays an important role in mitigating downstream sequencing quality issues. Importantly for MTB, the Illumina TruSeq library preparation kit produces more uniform data quality than the Nextera XT method, regardless of the quality of the input DNA. Furthermore, specific genomic sequence motifs are commonly missed by the Nextera XT method, as are regions of especially high GC-content relative to the rest of the MTB genome. As coverage bias is highly undesirable, this study illustrates the importance of appropriate protocol selection when performing NGS studies in order to ensure that sound inferences can be made regarding mycobacterial genomes.

We present an approach in which 192 sequencing libraries can be produced in a single day of technician time at a cost of about $15 per sample. These libraries are effective not only for low-pass whole-genome sequencing, but also for simultaneously enriching them in pools of approximately 100 individually barcoded samples for a subset of the genome without substantial loss in efficiency of target capture. We illustrate the power and effectiveness of this approach on about 2000 samples from a prostate cancer study.	N.

Many modifications have been introduced to the original 1869 method. Modern processes are categorized into chemical or mechanical, each with peculiarities that influence their use, especially in point-of-care diagnostics (POC-Dx). POC-Dx is a new approach aiming to replace sophisticated analytical machinery with microanalytical systems, able to be used near the patient, at the point of care or point of need. Although notable efforts have been made, a simple and effective extraction method is still a major challenge for widespread use of POC-Dx. In this review, we dissected the working principle of each of the most common NAE methods, overviewing their advantages and disadvantages, as well their potential for integration in POC-Dx systems. At present, it seems difficult, if not impossible, to establish a procedure which can be universally applied to POC-Dx. We also discuss the effects of the NAE chemicals upon the main plastic polymers used to mass produce POC-Dx systems. We end our review discussing the limitations and challenges that should guide the quest for an efficient extraction method that can be integrated in a POC-Dx system.	N.

With the advent of new anti-HCMV drugs there is therefore considerable interest in using virus sequence data to monitor emerging resistance to antiviral drugs in HCMV viraemia and disease, including the identification of putative new mutations. We used target-enrichment to deep sequence HCMV DNA from 11 immunosuppressed pediatric patients receiving single or combination anti-HCMV treatment, serially sampled over 1–27 weeks. Changes in consensus sequence and resistance mutations were analyzed for three ORFs targeted by anti-HCMV drugs and the frequencies of drug resistance mutations monitored. Targeted-enriched sequencing of clinical material detected mutations occurring at frequencies of 2%. Seven patients showed no evidence of drug resistance mutations. Four patients developed drug resistance mutations a mean of 16 weeks after starting treatment. In two patients, multiple resistance mutations accumulated at frequencies of 20% or less, including putative maribavir and ganciclovir resistance mutations P522Q (UL54) and C480F (UL97). In one patient, resistance was detected 14 days earlier than by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis suggested recombination or superinfection in one patient. Deep sequencing of HCMV enriched from clinical samples excluded resistance in 7 of 11 subjects and identified resistance mutations earlier than conventional PCR-based resistance testing in 2 patients. Detection of multiple low level resistance mutations was associated with poor outcome.	C.

The classical HLA class I and II genes define the specificity of adaptive immune responses. Genetic variation at the HLA genes is associated with susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases and plays a major role in transplantation medicine and immunology. Currently, the HLA genes are characterized using Sanger- or next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a limited amplicon repertoire or labeled oligonucleotides for allele-specific sequences. High-quality NGS-based methods are in proprietary use and not publicly available. Here, we introduce the first highly automated open-kit/open-source HLA-typing method for NGS. The method employs in-solution targeted capturing of the classical class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C) and class II HLA genes (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1). The calling algorithm allows for highly confident allele-calling to three-field resolution (cDNA nucleotide variants). The method was validated on 357 commercially available DNA samples with known HLA alleles obtained by classical typing. Our results showed on average an accurate allele call rate of 0.99 in a fully automated manner, identifying also errors in the reference data. Finally, our method provides the flexibility to add further enrichment target regions.		79	6	1	{"status":"GOLD","url":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/43/11/e70/3989946/gkv184.pdf"}	["JournalArticle"]	32		{"model":"tldr@v2.0.0","text":"The first highly automated open-kit/open-source HLA-typing method for NGS is introduced, which employs in-solution targeted capturing of the classical class I and II HLA genes and provides the flexibility to add further enrichment target regions."}	https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b40383307451ff624ddcb63bf7df2dc477ca45c6

The ability to explore a genetic design space by building extensive libraries of DNA constructs is essential for creating programmed biological systems that perform the desired functions. With multiple DNA assembly methods and standards adopted in the Synthetic Biology community, automation of the DNA assembly process has received serious attention in recent years. Importantly, automating DNA assembly enables larger builds using less researcher time, increasing the accessible design space. However, these benefits currently incur high costs for both equipment and consumables. Here, we address this limitation by introducing low-cost DNA assembly with BASIC on OpenTrons (DNA-BOT). For this purpose, we developed an open-source software package dnabot (https://github.com/BASIC-DNA-ASSEMBLY/dnabot). We demonstrate the performance of DNA-BOT by simultaneously assembling 88 constructs composed of 10 genetic parts, exploring the promoter, ribosome binding site (RBS) and gene order design space for a 3-gene operon. All 88 constructs were assembled with high accuracy, at a cost of $1.50 - $5.50 per construct. This illustrates the efficiency, accuracy and affordability of DNA-BOT making it accessible for most labs and democratising automated DNA assembly.	M.

This study is significant in that it demonstrates just such a technology, avian leukosis virus (ALV) polypeptide display, supplying an innovative and substantive departure from the status quo of antibody display that uses platforms based on microorganisms. The use of eukaryotic cells provides the assurance of maximizing the proper folding, posttranslational modifications, and display of the single-chain Fv antibodies and the virus fusion proteins in virions and on the cell surface. ALV display offers virus and cell display platforms in a eukaryotic expression system. Antibody-based therapeutics have now had success in the clinic. The affinity and specificity of the antibody for the target ligand determines the specificity of therapeutic delivery and off-target side effects. The discovery and optimization of high-affinity antibodies to important therapeutic targets could be significantly improved by the availability of a robust, eukaryotic display technology comparable to phage display that would overcome the protein translation limitations of microorganisms. The use of eukaryotic cells would improve the diversity of the displayed antibodies that can be screened and optimized as well as more seamlessly transition into a large-scale mammalian expression system for clinical production. In this study, we demonstrate that the replication and polypeptide display characteristics of a eukaryotic retrovirus, avian leukosis virus (ALV), offers a robust, eukaryotic version of bacteriophage display. The binding affinity of a model single-chain Fv antibody was optimized by using ALV display, improving affinity >2,000-fold, from micromolar to picomolar levels. We believe ALV display provides an extension to antibody display on microorganisms and offers virus and cell display platforms in a eukaryotic expression system. ALV display should enable an improvement in the diversity of properly processed and functional antibody variants that can be screened and affinity-optimized to improve promising antibody candidates.

TALEs are used in genome engineering for locus-specific DNA editing and imaging, as artificial transcriptional activators and repressors, and for targeted epigenetic modification. TALEs as nucleases (TALENs) are effective editing tools and offer high binding specificity and fewer sequence constraints toward the targeted genome than other custom nuclease systems. One bottleneck of broader TALE use is reagent accessibility. For example, one commonly deployed method uses a multitube, 5-day assembly protocol. Here we describe FusX, a streamlined Golden Gate TALE assembly system that (1) is backward compatible with popular TALE backbones, (2) is functionalized as a single-tube 3-day TALE assembly process, (3) requires only commonly used basic molecular biology reagents, and (4) is cost-effective. More than 100 TALEN pairs have been successfully assembled using FusX, and 27 pairs were quantitatively tested in zebrafish, with each showing high somatic and germline activity. Furthermore, this assembly system is flexible and is compatible with standard molecular biology laboratory tools, but can be scaled with automated laboratory support. To demonstrate, we use a highly accessible and commercially available liquid-handling robot to rapidly and accurately assemble TALEs using the FusX TALE toolkit. Together, the FusX system accelerates TALE-based genomic science applications from basic science screening work for functional genomics testing and molecular medicine applications.	Alvin C.

Wild birds, including American crows, are abundant in urban, suburban, and agricultural settings and are likely zoonotic vectors of Campylobacter. Their proximity to humans and livestock increases the potential spreading of Campylobacter via crows between the environment, livestock, and humans. However, no studies have definitively demonstrated that crows are a vector for pathogenic Campylobacter. We used genomics to evaluate the zoonotic and pathogenic potential of Campylobacter from crows to other animals with 184 isolates obtained from crows, chickens, cows, sheep, goats, humans, and nonhuman primates. Whole-genome analysis uncovered two distinct clades of Campylobacter jejuni genotypes; the first contained genotypes found only in crows, while a second genotype contained “generalist” genomes that were isolated from multiple host species, including isolates implicated in human disease, primate gastroenteritis, and livestock abortion. Two major β-lactamase genes were observed frequently in these genomes (oxa-184, 55%, and oxa-61, 29%), where oxa-184 was associated only with crows and oxa-61 was associated with generalists. Mutations in gyrA, indicative of fluoroquinolone resistance, were observed in 14% of the isolates. Tetracycline resistance (tetO) was present in 22% of the isolates, yet it occurred in 91% of the abortion isolates. Virulence genes were distributed throughout the genomes; however, cdtC alleles recapitulated the crow-only and generalist clades. A specific cdtC allele was associated with abortion in livestock and was concomitant with tetO. These findings indicate that crows harboring a generalist C. jejuni genotype may act as a vector for the zoonotic transmission of Campylobacter. IMPORTANCE This study examined the link between public health and the genomic variation of Campylobacter in relation to disease in humans, primates, and livestock. Use of large-scale whole-genome sequencing enabled population-level assessment to find new genes that are linked to livestock disease. With 184 Campylobacter genomes, we assessed virulence traits, antibiotic resistance susceptibility, and the potential for zoonotic transfer to observe that there is a “generalist” genotype that may move between host species.

The in meso method introduced a few years ago has produced crystal structures of a number of important membrane proteins. The bottleneck to achieve high throughput automation of this, so-called in meso method, is the handling of nanoliter volumes of the highly viscous cubic phase as part of the crystallization process. The cubic phase sticks to everything that it has contact with and has a tendency to disable dispensing robotic tools. In this paper, we discuss the factors that influence the successful and automatic delivery of nanoliter volumes of the cubic phase. A creative cubic-phase-based coordinate measuring mechanism is presented for controlling the dispensing distance of the cubic phase which is critically important for the successful performance of the system. A mathematical model describing the cubic-phase delivery is proposed and verified. We also present the optimization of liquid handling parameters for the successful and automatic delivery of different precipitant solutions. The performance characteristics of the robotic system in terms of accuracy and reproducibility of delivering nano volumes of highly viscous biomaterials and micro volumes of different precipitant solutions are reported. Note to Practitioners-Automatic handling of nanoliter volumes of highly viscous biomaterials is a practically challenging yet important task in research-and-development activities of biology and drug industry, including protein crystallization. The latter, however, is a key step for determining the structure of the proteins. Only when the structure of the proteins is revealed, can one understand the function of the proteins and/or develop drugs to cure various kinds of diseases. This paper uses a practical project, crystallizing membrane proteins using lipidic mesophases, as an example to develop approaches for automatically handling highly viscous biomaterials. This paper presents the factors that influence the successful and automatic delivery of nanoliter volumes of viscous biomaterials and introduces a new coordinate measuring mechanism using the viscous biomaterials for controlling the dispensing distance of the biomaterials, which is critical for the successful delivery of viscous materials. A mathematical model describing the delivery of viscous material is for guiding the design of practical delivering systems. This paper also presents a number of parameters for successful and automatic delivery of different precipitant solutions which are involved in the biomaterial screening activities in drug development and biological research. A simple and effective computer vision approach for measuring the volume of bio-solutions and biomaterials in the nanoliter scale is presented which is verified by the fluorescence intensity measurement of the delivered samples. The performance of the automatic system developed in terms of accuracy and reproducibility of delivering nanovolumes of highly viscous biomaterials is reported which proves that the proposed approach is not only practically useful but also feasible for many applications	A.

However, several challenges still remain to be addressed before it can deliver on its promises. One of the most important issues to address is the lack of reproducibility within research of the life sciences. This problem is beginning to be recognised by the community and solutions are being developed to tackle the problem. The recent emergence of automated facilities that are open for use by researchers (such as biofoundries and cloud labs) may be one of the ways that synthetic biologists can improve the quality and reproducibility of their work. In this perspective article, we outline these and some of the other technologies that are currently being developed which we believe may help to transform how synthetic biologists approach their research activities.

A Cost Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing.	BACKGROUNDThe substantial technological advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS), combined with dropping costs, have allowed for a swift diffusion of NGS applications in clinical settings. Although several commercial parties report to have broken the $1000 barrier for sequencing an entire human genome, a valid cost overview for NGS is currently lacking. This study provides a complete, transparent and up-to-date overview of the total costs of different NGS applications.METHODSCost calculations for targeted gene panels (TGP), whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were based on the Illumina NextSeq500, HiSeq4000, and HiSeqX5 platforms, respectively. To anticipate future developments, sensitivity analyses are performed.RESULTSPer-sample costs were €1669 for WGS, € 792 for WES and €333 for TGP. To reach the coveted $1000 genome, not only is the long-term and efficient use of the sequencing equipment needed, but also large reductions in capital costs and especially consumable costs are also required.CONCLUSIONSWES and TGP are considerably lower-cost alternatives to WGS. However, this does not imply that these NGS approaches should be preferred in clinical practice, since this should be based on the tradeoff between costs and the expected clinical utility of the approach chosen. The results of the present study contribute to the evaluation of such tradeoffs.	K.

In recent years, NGS technology has steadily improved, with costs dropping and the number and range of sequencing applications increasing exponentially. Here, we examine the critical role of sequencing library quality and consider important challenges when preparing NGS libraries from DNA and RNA sources. Factors such as the quantity and physical characteristics of the RNA or DNA source material as well as the desired application (i.e., genome sequencing, targeted sequencing, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, RIP-seq, and methylation) are addressed in the context of preparing high quality sequencing libraries.

These highly complex models of human disease often require increasingly convoluted genetic analysis. With growing needs for throughput and consistency, we find that traditional aspiration-and-dispense liquid-handling robots no longer have the required speed, quality, or reproducibility. We present an adaptation and installation of an acoustic droplet ejection (ADE) liquid-handling system for ultra-high-throughput screening of genetically engineered models. An ADE system is fully integrated with existing laboratory processes and platforms to facilitate execution of PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR) reactions. Such a configuration permits interrogation of highly complex genetic models in a variety of backgrounds. Our findings demonstrate that a single ADE system replaces 8–10 traditional liquid-handling robots while increasing quality and reproducibility. We demonstrate significant improvements achieved by transitioning to an ADE device: extremely low detectable cross-contamination in PCR and qPCR despite extensive use, greatly increased data reproducibility (large increases in data quality and Cq consistency), lowered reaction volumes for large cost savings, and nearly a magnitude increase in speed per instrument. We show several comparisons between traditional- and ADE-based pipetting for a qPCR-based workflow.

In multicellular organisms, biological function emerges when heterogeneous cell types form complex organs. Nevertheless, dissection of tissues into mixtures of cellular subpopulations is currently challenging. We introduce an automated massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach for analyzing in vivo transcriptional states in thousands of single cells. Combined with unsupervised classification algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy. These data demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an effective tool for comprehensive cellular decomposition of complex tissues. Introducing MARS-Seq Immune cells are typically differentiated by surface markers; however, this designation is somewhat crude and does not allow for fine distinctions that might be characterized by their RNA transcripts. Jaitin et al. (p. 776) used massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (MARS-Seq) analysis to explore cellular heterogeneity within the immune system by assembling an automated experimental platform that enables RNA profiling of cells sorted from tissues using flow cytometry. More than 1000 cells could be sequenced, and unsupervised clustering analysis of the RNA profiles revealed distinct cellular groupings that corresponded to B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This approach provides the ability to perform a bottom-up characterization of in vivo cell-type landscapes independent of cell markers or prior knowledge.

Here, we demonstrate that when mice are fed an obesogenic Western diet (WD), they become susceptible to lethal sepsis with multiple organ damage after exposure to antibiotics and an otherwise-recoverable surgical injury. Analysis of the gut microbiota in this model demonstrates that WD alone leads to loss of Bacteroidetes, a bloom of Proteobacteria, and evidence of antibiotic resistance development even before antibiotics are administered. After antibiotics and surgery, lethal sepsis with organ damage developed in in mice fed a WD with the appearance of multidrug-resistant pathogens in the liver, spleen, and blood. The importance of these findings lies in exposing how the selective pressures of diet, antibiotic exposure, and surgical injury can converge on the microbiome, resulting in lethal sepsis and organ damage without the introduction of an exogenous pathogen. ABSTRACT Despite antibiotics and sterile technique, postoperative infections remain a real and present danger to patients. Recent estimates suggest that 50% of the pathogens associated with postoperative infections have become resistant to the standard antibiotics used for prophylaxis. Risk factors identified in such cases include obesity and antibiotic exposure. To study the combined effect of obesity and antibiotic exposure on postoperative infection, mice were allowed to gain weight on an obesogenic Western-type diet (WD), administered antibiotics and then subjected to an otherwise recoverable sterile surgical injury (30% hepatectomy). The feeding of a WD alone resulted in a major imbalance of the cecal microbiota characterized by a decrease in diversity, loss of Bacteroidetes, a bloom in Proteobacteria, and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms among the cecal microbiota. When WD-fed mice were administered antibiotics and subjected to 30% liver resection, lethal sepsis, characterized by multiple-organ damage, developed. Notable was the emergence and systemic dissemination of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathobionts, including carbapenem-resistant, extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Serratia marcescens, which expressed a virulent and immunosuppressive phenotype. Analysis of the distribution of exact sequence variants belonging to the genus Serratia suggested that these strains originated from the cecal mucosa. No mortality or MDR pathogens were observed in identically treated mice fed a standard chow diet. Taken together, these results suggest that consumption of a Western diet and exposure to certain antibiotics may predispose to life-threating postoperative infection associated with MDR organisms present among the gut microbiota. IMPORTANCE Obesity remains a prevalent and independent risk factor for life-threatening infection following major surgery. Here, we demonstrate that when mice are fed an obesogenic Western diet (WD), they become susceptible to lethal sepsis with multiple organ damage after exposure to antibiotics and an otherwise-recoverable surgical injury. Analysis of the gut microbiota in this model demonstrates that WD alone leads to loss of Bacteroidetes, a bloom of Proteobacteria, and evidence of antibiotic resistance development even before antibiotics are administered.

These experiments are particularly well suited for automation because they often stretch over long periods of time, possibly hours, and often require that the human takes action in response to observed events such as changes in droplet size, count, shape, or clustering or declustering of multiple droplets. Our robot is designed to monitor long-term experiments and, based on the feedback from the experiment, interact with it. The combination of precise automation, accurately collected experiment data, and integrated analysis and modeling software makes real-time interaction with the experiment feasible, as opposed to traditional offline processing of experiments. Last but not least, we believe the low cost of our platform can promote artificial life research. Furthermore, prevalently, findings from an experiment will inspire redesign for novel experiments. In addition, the robot’s open-source software enables easy modification of experiments. We will cover two case studies for application of our robot in feedback-based experiments and demonstrate how our robot can not only automate these experiments, collect data, and interact with the experiments intelligently but also enable chemists to perform formerly infeasible experiments.

We present OpenLH, a liquid handling system that empowers users to conduct accurate and repetitive experiments with live biology in a sterile, open, and affordable way. OpenLH integrates a commercially available robotic arm with custom 3D printed parts, a modified pipette, and a visual block-based programming interface. The system is as accurate as commercial liquid handlers, capable of repetitive tasks in micro-scale accuracy, easy to operate, and supports multi-materials including biomaterials, microorganisms and cell cultures. We describe the system's technical implementation and two custom interfaces. We demonstrate the system's impact for the HCI community with two use cases that include experimentation with live biology in non-traditional fields: visual design using pigment-expressing E.coli, and beer brewing experiment using serial dilution in home context.

As robots start working side by side with scientists, robotic automation of microfluidics in general, and droplet microfluidics in particular, will significantly extend and accelerate the life sciences. Here, we demonstrate the automation of droplet microfluidics using an inexpensive liquid-handling robot to produce human scaffold-free cell spheroids at high throughput. We use pipette actuation and interface the pipetting tip with a droplet-generating microfluidic device. In this device, we produce highly monodisperse droplets with a diameter coefficient of variation (CV) lower than 2%. By encapsulating cells in these droplets, we produce cell spheroids in droplets and recover them to standard labware containers at a throughput of 85,000 spheroids per microfluidic circuit per hour. The viability of the cells in spheroids remains high throughout the process and decreases by >10% (depending on the cell line used) after a 16 h incubation period in nanoliter droplets and automated recovery. Scaffold-free cell spheroids and 3D tissue constructs recapitulate many aspects of functional human tissue more accurately than 2D or single-cell cultures, but assembly methods for spheroids (e.g., hanging drop microplates) have limited throughput. The increased throughput and decreased cost of our method enable spheroid production at the scale needed for lead discovery drug screening, and approach the cost at which these microtissues could be used as building blocks for organ-scale regenerative medicine.

Genomic testing brings with it a greater opportunity for diagnosis, or predictions of future diagnoses, but also an increased chance of uncertain or unexpected findings, many of which may have impacts for multiple members of a person’s family. In the past, genetic testing was rarely able to provide rapid results, but the increasing speed and availability of genomic testing is changing this, meaning that genomic information is increasingly influencing decisions around patient care in the acute inpatient setting. The landscape of treatment options for genetic conditions is shifting, which has evolving implications for clinical discussions around previously untreatable disorders. Furthermore, the point of access to testing is changing with increasing provision direct to the consumer outside the formal healthcare setting. This review outlines the ways in which genetic medicine is developing in light of technological advances.

However, the extreme sensitivity of such techniques can easily result in contamination. This is a major problem in using these techniques routinely in a regulatory agency such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because false-positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results will fail our mission. Preventing PCR carryover contamination and a capacity to rapidly determine false PCR positives are crucial. In the past, several methods have been used to prevent amplicon carryover contamination. In this chapter, we provide practical suggestions for PCR carryover contamination detection and prevention that work well with most PCR applications in our laboratory.

HTS robots capable of low-volume dispensing reduce assay setup times and provide highly accurate and reproducible dispensing, minimizing variation between sample replicates and eliminating the potential for manual error. Low-volume automated nanoliter dispensers ensure accuracy of pipetting within volume ranges that are difficult to achieve manually. In addition, they have the ability to potentially expand the range of screening conditions from often limited amounts of valuable sample, as well as reduce the usage of expensive reagents. The ability to accurately dispense lower volumes provides the potential to achieve a greater amount of information than could be otherwise achieved using manual dispensing technology. With the emergence of the field of epigenetics, an increasing number of drug discovery companies are beginning to screen compound libraries against a range of epigenetic targets. This review discusses the potential for the use of low-volume liquid handling robots, for molecular biological applications such as quantitative PCR and epigenetics.	W.

Spontaneous mutations that arise before or during use can impact heterologous genetic functions, disrupt system integration, or change organism phenotype. Here, we propose restructuring the genetic code itself such that all point mutations in protein-coding sequences are selected against. Synthetic genetic systems so-encoded should “fail safely” in response to many individual spontaneous mutations. We designed a family of such fail-safe codes and analyzed their expected effect on the evolution of engineered organisms via simulation. We predict that fail-safe codes supporting expression of 20 or 15 amino acids could slow the evolution of proteins in so-encoded organisms to 30% or 0% the rate of standard-code organisms, respectively. We also designed quadruplet-codon codes that should be capable of encoding at least 20 amino acids while ensuring all single point mutations in protein-coding sequences are selected against. We show by in vitro experiments that a reduced set of 21 tRNA is capable of expressing a protein whose coding sequence is recoded to use a fail-safe code, whereas a standard-code encoding is not expressed. Our work suggests that a rationally depleted but otherwise natural translation system should yield biological systems with intrinsically reduced evolutionary capacity, and that so-encoded hypoevolvable organisms might be less likely to invade new niches or outcompete native populations.

A myeloid neoplasm-relevant 27-gene panel was used for next-generation sequencing of bone marrow or whole blood DNA in 182 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF). DNA sequence variants/mutations other than JAK2/CALR/MPL were detected in 147 patients (81%), with the most frequent being ASXL1 (36%), TET2 (18%), SRSF2 (18%), and U2AF1 (16%); furthermore, 35%, 26%, 10%, and 9% of the patients harbored 1, 2, 3, or 4 or more such variants/mutations, respectively. Adverse variants/mutations were identified by age-adjusted multivariable analysis of impact on overall survival or leukemia-free survival and included ASXL1, SRSF2, CBL, KIT, RUNX1, SH2B3, and CEBPA; their combined prevalence was 56%. Adverse variants/mutations were associated with inferior overall survival (median, 3.6 vs 8.5 years; P < .001) and leukemia-free survival (7-year risk, 25% vs 4%; P < .001), and the effect on survival was independent of both the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System Plus and JAK2/CALR/MPL mutational status, with respective hazard ratios of 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.1) and 2.9 (95% CI, 1.9-4.4). Additional prognostic information was obtained by considering the number of adverse variants/mutations; median survivals in patients with zero (n = 80), 1 or 2 (n = 93), or 3 or more (n = 9) adverse variants/mutations were 8.5, 4, and 0.7 years, respectively (P < .001). Additional data were obtained on pattern of mutation co-segregation and phenotypic correlation, including significant associations between U2AF1 and JAK2 mutations (P = .04) and U2AF1 mutations and anemia (P = .003) and thrombocytopenia (P = .006). We conclude that DNA variants/mutations other than JAK2/CALR/MPL are prevalent in PMF and are qualitatively and quantitatively relevant in predicting overall and leukemia-free survival.	A.

NGS technology has brought massively high throughput sequencing data to bear on research questions, enabling a new era of genomic research. Development of bioinformatic software for NGS has provided more opportunities for researchers to use various applications in genomic fields. De novo genome assembly and large scale DNA resequencing to understand genomic variations are popular genomic research tools for processing a tremendous amount of data at low cost. Studies on transcriptomes are now available, from previous-hybridization based microarray methods. Epigenetic studies are also available with NGS applications such as whole genome methylation sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing. Human genetics has faced a new paradigm of research and medical genomics by sequencing technologies since the Human Genome Project. The trend of NGS technologies in human genomics has brought a new era of WGS by enabling the building of human genomes databases and providing appropriate human reference genomes, which is a necessary component of personalized medicine and precision medicine.
